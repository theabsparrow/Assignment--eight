# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

five characteristics of my website
- **Component-Based Architecture**: React uses a component-based architecture, where you create reusable UI components that manage their state and can be composed together to build complex user interfaces.
- **Virtual DOM**: React utilizes a virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI. Instead of directly manipulating the browser's DOM, React creates a virtual representation of the DOM in memory and updates it as needed, minimizing unnecessary DOM manipulations.
- **JSX Syntax**: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript files. It's used in React to define the structure of UI components.
- **State Management**: React provides a built-in state management system that allows components to manage their internal state. This enables dynamic and interactive UIs by updating the state in response to user actions or other events.
- **Lifecycle Methods**: React components have lifecycle methods that allow you to hook into various stages of a component's life, such as when it's mounted or updated. These methods enable you to perform actions like fetching data, handling side effects, or cleaning up resources.
